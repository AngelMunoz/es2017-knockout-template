# Knockout in 2021
Well knockout is a relic of the past for most yet I have learned during the last few days that it isn't that outated as it seems!

here you can see knockout in a "modern" setup which is not that complicated since we're relying on browser standards like ES2015 (classes, template strings) and ES modules


# Use
Ust this template from github or clone and run
```sh
pnpm install # npm install or yarn install
pnpm start # npm start or yarn start
```
This should bring the template live at `localhost:8080`
